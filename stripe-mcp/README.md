**Manage your entire Stripe account — customers, subscriptions, invoices, and analytics — with natural language. 79 tools. One command. Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf.**

---

## Why this exists

- **No other Stripe MCP has analytics.** MRR, churn, revenue summaries, top customers, failed-payment reports — all computed client-side. Stripe has no native MRR endpoint; we implemented the canonical Baremetrics/ChartMogul methodology.
- **One command to install.** `npm install -g stripe-mcp` and you're talking to Stripe from Claude in 30 seconds. No servers, no ports, no auth headers.
- **Typed end-to-end.** TypeScript strict mode, zod runtime validation on every input, zero `any`. Stripe SDK types flow all the way through to the LLM.

## Quick start

**1. Install**

```bash
npm install -g stripe-mcp
```

**2. Get a Stripe secret key**

Grab a restricted test key from the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). It starts with `sk_test_`.

```bash
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

**3. Wire it into your MCP client**

**Claude Desktop** — edit `claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stripe": {
      "command": "stripe-mcp",
      "env": { "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": "sk_test_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — `Settings → MCP → Add new MCP server`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stripe": {
      "command": "stripe-mcp",
      "env": { "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": "sk_test_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windsurf** — `Settings → MCP Servers → Add Server`, same JSON shape.

Restart your client. You should see `stripe-mcp` log `✓ Test mode (no real charges).` and you're live.

## Compatible with

✅ Claude Desktop · ✅ Cursor · ✅ Windsurf · ✅ Any MCP-compatible client

### ⚡ Analytics (5) — the crown jewel

These are the killer feature. **No other Stripe MCP server has them.** They compute MRR, churn, revenue summaries, top customers, and failed-payment reports by paginating Stripe resources client-side and aggregating locally — Stripe has no native MRR endpoint, so we implement the canonical Baremetrics/ChartMogul methodology ourselves.

| Tool | What it does | Example prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stripe_analytics_get_mrr` | Compute Monthly Recurring Revenue with by-plan, by-currency, and top-customer breakdowns. | "Show me my MRR and which plan is growing fastest." |
| `stripe_analytics_get_churn_rate` | Compute subscription churn rate for any period, with per-customer LTV estimates. | "What's my churn rate over the last 90 days?" |
| `stripe_analytics_get_revenue_summary` | Aggregate gross/net revenue, refunds, payment counts, failure rate, and a time series. | "Give me a revenue summary for the last 30 days." |
| `stripe_analytics_get_top_customers` | Rank customers by lifetime value, MRR, or payment count. | "Who are my top 10 customers by lifetime value?" |
| `stripe_analytics_get_failed_payments_report` | Break down failed charges by decline code with per-customer recovery suggestions. | "List all failed payments from the last 30 days with failure reasons." |

---

## Analytics spotlight

Stripe exposes no MRR endpoint, no churn endpoint, no "revenue summary" endpoint. Every other Stripe MCP server punts on analytics. We didn't.

### What each tool returns

**`stripe_analytics_get_mrr`** — `{ total_mrr, total_mrr_formatted, mrr_by_plan, mrr_by_currency, top_customers_by_mrr, active_subscription_count, currency, computed_at }`

**`stripe_analytics_get_churn_rate`** — `{ churn_rate_percent, churned_count, active_at_period_start, period_start, period_end, interval, churned_customers: [{ subscription_id, customer_id, email, canceled_at, canceled_at_iso, lifetime_value_estimate, cancellation_reason }] }`

**`stripe_analytics_get_revenue_summary`** — `{ gross_revenue, net_revenue, refund_amount, refund_rate_percent, successful_payments, failed_payments, failure_rate_percent, avg_transaction_value, time_series: [{ date, gross, net, count }] }`

**`stripe_analytics_get_top_customers`** — `{ metric, metric_label, period_days, ranked: [{ rank, customer_id, email, name, value, value_formatted, metric_label }] }`

**`stripe_analytics_get_failed_payments_report`** — `{ total_failed_amount, count, failure_reasons_breakdown: { [decline_code]: { count, amount } }, affected_customers: [{ customer_id, email, failed_count, failed_amount, last_failure_decline_code, last_failure_at_iso, recovery_suggestion }] }`

### Sample conversation

> **You**: Show me my MRR and which plan is growing fastest.

`stripe_analytics_get_mrr` runs, paginates every active subscription, normalizes yearly/weekly/daily prices to monthly, and returns:

```json
{
  "total_mrr": 5280.00,
  "total_mrr_formatted": "$5280.00",
  "mrr_by_plan": {
    "Pro":     { "mrr": 3000.00, "customer_count": 150 },
    "Annual":  { "mrr": 2280.00, "customer_count": 190 }
  },
  "mrr_by_currency": { "usd": 5280.00, "eur": 1190.00 },
  "top_customers_by_mrr": [
    { "customer_id": "cus_1", "email": "acme@example.com", "name": "Acme", "mrr": 499.00, "mrr_formatted": "$499.00" },
    { "customer_id": "cus_2", "email": "globex@example.com", "name": "Globex", "mrr": 299.00, "mrr_formatted": "$299.00" }
  ],
  "active_subscription_count": 340,
  "currency": "usd",
  "computed_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

The LLM reads the JSON, you get a natural-language answer: _"Your MRR is $5,280.00 across 340 active subscriptions. The Pro plan is growing fastest — it's contributing $3,000/mo across 150 customers vs the Annual plan at $2,280/mo across 190 customers. You also have €1,190/mo in EUR. Your top MRR customer is Acme at $499/mo."_

No CSV exports, no SQL, no ChartMogul subscription. Just ask.

## Example prompts

Curated power-user prompts. Drop these into Claude/Cursor/Windsurf and watch them chain multiple tools together.

1. **"Show me my MRR and which plan is growing fastest."**
2. **"Cancel the subscription for john@example.com and refund his last invoice."**
3. **"List all failed payments from the last 30 days with failure reasons."**
4. **"Create a 3-month 50% off coupon and generate a payment link for the Pro plan."**
5. **"Who are my top 10 customers by lifetime value?"**
6. **"Pause every subscription for customer cus_abc and tell me when you're done."**
7. **"Finalize and send all open invoices."**
8. **"What's my churn rate over the last 90 days?"**

## Safety

### Test vs live mode

stripe-mcp detects your key prefix at startup and warns you clearly:

```
⚠️  LIVE MODE — real money affected. Proceed with caution.
```

or

```
✓ Test mode (no real charges).
```

- **`sk_test_...`** → test mode. No real charges, no real customers, no real money. Recommended for first runs.
- **`sk_live_...`** → live mode. Real money. stripe-mcp logs a loud warning on startup.

**Start with a test key.** Don't wire a live key into Claude Desktop until you've poked around test mode for an afternoon.

### Read-only vs destructive tools

**Read-only (safe to let the LLM run freely):**

- `*_get`, `*_list`, `*_search`
- `stripe_balance_get`, `stripe_balance_list_transactions`
- All five `stripe_analytics_*` tools

**Destructive (real money / state changes):**

- `*_create`, `*_update`, `*_delete`, `*_cancel`
- `stripe_refunds_create`, `stripe_invoices_pay`, `stripe_invoices_void`
- `stripe_subscriptions_cancel`, `stripe_customers_delete`, `stripe_webhooks_delete`
- `stripe_payouts_create`, `stripe_payouts_cancel`
- `stripe_checkout_expire_session`, `stripe_disputes_close`

The MCP protocol doesn't (yet) have a built-in read-only mode — your client
may. For full safety, point Claude at a test-mode key and a restricted key
with only the permissions you want to grant.

## Architecture

- **ESM-first.** Node 20+, no CommonJS interop. `tsup` builds `dist/index.js` with a `#!/usr/bin/env node` banner.
- **TypeScript strict.** `strict`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`. Zero `any` anywhere.
- **Zod-validated inputs.** Every tool declares a zod schema, calls `safeParse`, and returns `Validation error: ...` on bad input. The JSON-Schema in the MCP manifest is mirrored by hand from the zod schema so the LLM sees accurate descriptions.
- **stdio transport only.** No HTTP server, no ports, no auth. Universal MCP standard for local tools.
- **Mocked tests.** `vi.mock()` on the Stripe client. No real Stripe calls in CI.
- **Auto-pagination.** `paginateAll<T>` walks every page (capped by `max_items`, default 1000) and returns `{ total_count, has_more, data }`.
- **`buildStripeParams<P>`** helper that drops `undefined` keys so zod-validated input flows into typed Stripe SDK calls without fighting `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

See [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md) for the why behind each of these.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guillaumeCode2012/stripe-mcp.git
cd stripe-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide — adding a new
tool takes about 15 minutes and follows a strict template (zod schema, mirrored
JSON-Schema, `buildStripeParams<P>` for the Stripe call, `formatStripeError`
on catch, `paginateAll` for lists).

---

## Contributing

PRs welcome. The codebase is structured so that adding a tool never causes
merge conflicts with other contributors — each category lives in its own
folder under `src/tools/`, registers itself in a category barrel, and the
top-level `src/tools/index.ts` simply spreads every category into
`allTools`. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the tool template,
code style rules, and PR checklist.
